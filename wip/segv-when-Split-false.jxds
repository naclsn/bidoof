# observed when typed out at the repl:
#    b is an invalid object likely
#    to cause a segv or show unknown
# observed when `.source`d:
#    only a exists afterward
#    (because the second `c =` isn't reached)
# so maybe b is freed early when Split fails
# when the declaration order for a and b are
# swapped a becomes invalid
